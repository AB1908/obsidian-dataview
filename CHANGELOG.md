# 0.4.11

Fixes task behavior and adds "truly inline" fields!

## Improved Task Behavior

Task queries are now much improved from their primitive foundations - you can now filter, sort, and group them! The FROM
block is still page-based, sadly, though you can simply use `WHERE` instead if desired. For example, you can now access
task fields like `text`, `line`, or `completed`:

```
TASK WHERE contains(text, "#tag")
WHERE !completed
GROUP BY file.folder
```

The full list of all available task metadata can be found
[here](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/#tasks); tasks include all the information
needed to uniquely identify them, and automatically inherit all of the metadata from their parent file as well (so you
can access `file.name`, for example). You can also annotate tasks with inline fields, as described in the section below.

There is some additional UX work to be done - primarily on more easily allowing you to navigate to where the task is
defined, as well as render tasks in views other than the `TASK` view.  The semantics of how grouping works (to make it
more intuitive/useful than it currently is) will likely also be revisited.

## Inline Inline Fields

Early support for truly inline fields have been added, where you can add metadata in the middle of a sentence. It looks
similar to existing inline field syntax, but with brackets or parenthesis:

```
I would rate this a [rating:: 6]. It was (thoughts:: acceptable).
```

Improved rendering for all inline fields is coming in an unpcoming update to improve the visual look of these inline
fields.


## Issues

- Fix #496: Fix task `SORT` functionality to do something.
- Fix #492: Tasks now properly annotated with parent file information.
- Fix #498: Fix task checking/unchecking logic (which broke due to a change in the task regex...).
